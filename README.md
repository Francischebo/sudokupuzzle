# sudokupuzzle
Sudoku solver

It defines a SudokuSolverGUI class that contains the GUI elements for the Sudoku solver, including a 9x9 grid of input cells representing the Sudoku board, a "Solve" button, and a message box to display the result of solving the board.

The __init__ method of the SudokuSolverGUI class initializes the GUI window using the tkinter library, and creates the widgets for the board, solve button, and message box using the create_widgets method.

The create_widgets method creates the 9x9 grid of input cells using the tk.Entry widget, and adds them to the board_frame using the grid method. It also creates the "Solve" button and the message box using the tk.Button and tk.Message widgets, respectively.

The solve_board method gets the values from the input cells in the 9x9 grid, converts them to a 2D array representing the Sudoku board, and then solves the Sudoku board using the solve_sudoku function (not shown in the code). The solve_sudoku function uses a backtracking algorithm to find a solution to the Sudoku board.

Once the Sudoku board has been solved, the solve_board method updates the input cells in the 9x9 grid with the solution values, and displays a message in the message box indicating whether the board was solvable or not.

Finally, the run method creates an instance of the SudokuSolverGUI class with an initial Sudoku board, and starts the GUI event loop using the mainloop method of the tkinter library, which allows the user to interact with the GUI and solve the Sudoku puzzle.
